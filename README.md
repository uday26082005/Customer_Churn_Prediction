Perfect, Sneha 👍 I’ll clean up the formatting issues in your README and make it **GitHub-ready**.
Main fixes:

* Added spaces after `##` in headings.
* Properly indented code blocks with closing backticks.
* Added spacing before bullet points for readability.
* Fixed consistency in section headings.

Here’s your corrected version 👇

# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

A **Streamlit web app** that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their details, using a machine learning model trained on the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**.  
The app also suggests **retention strategies** for customers predicted to churn.


## 🚀 Features
- 🔮 **Churn Prediction** – Predicts if a customer is likely to leave.  
- 💡 **Retention Strategies** – Provides personalized suggestions to reduce churn.  
- 🖥 **Interactive Streamlit UI** – Easy-to-use sidebar for input.  
- 📊 **Input Summary Tables** – Displays customer details in structured tables.  
- 🛠 **Pre-trained Model** – Uses a pickled machine learning model (`customer_churn_model.pkl`) and encoders.  


## 📂 Project Structure
```

├── .devcontainer/
├── app.py                     # Main Streamlit app
├── customer\_churn\_model.pkl   # Trained ML model
├── encoders.pkl               # Encoders for categorical variables

## 🛠 How to Run the App Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📌 Example Retention Strategies

If a customer is predicted to churn, the app suggests strategies like:

* 💰 Offer discounts or bundle services for high monthly charges
* 📄 Promote long-term contracts with benefits
* 🛠 Provide free or discounted Tech Support trial
* 🔒 Give free Online Security for a limited time
* 🤝 Assign dedicated support for senior citizens with low tenure

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Telecom companies to identify at-risk customers
* Business analysts to understand churn patterns
* Customer success teams to design retention campaigns

👉 Now it’ll render properly with **headings, code blocks, and bullets aligned**.  

Want me to also make this README **fancy with badges** (like Python, Streamlit, License, etc.) at the top?
